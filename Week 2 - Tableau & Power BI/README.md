### Day 1: Tableau Research and Dashboard Creation

#### Task 1: Tableau Versions Comparison

[cite\_start]Research was conducted to compare different Tableau versions and explain the limitations of **Tableau Public**[cite: 4, 5].

  * [cite\_start]**Tableau Public Limitations:** Its functionality is limited primarily by a lack of **data security**, its inability to connect to **private databases and cloud services**, and its **online-only publishing model**[cite: 5].

#### Task 2: EMSI Job Change Dashboard

[cite\_start]A Tableau dashboard was created using the `EMSI_JobChange_UK` dataset[cite: 7].

  * [cite\_start]**Dashboard Components:** A bar chart showing **percentage change** and a UK-based map illustrating the **key city locations impacted**[cite: 7].

### Day 2: Advanced Data Analysis in Tableau

[cite\_start]Analysis was performed on two distinct datasets to find and document trends, with visualizations created for each[cite: 10, 15].

#### Task 1: Spotify Data Analysis

[cite\_start]Analysis was conducted to find trends and key information for potential future projects[cite: 10].

| Analysis Area | [cite\_start]Key Findings [cite: 13] |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Genre Popularity** | **Pop music** is the most popular genre on Spotify with 625,020 users. Acapella is the least popular with only 1,107 users. |
| **Popularity by Danceability** | **Hip-Hop** is the most danceable genre with a danceability score of 6,681, compared to Acapella's score of 49. |
| **Artist Analysis** | **Drake** is by far the most popular artist, with over 31,000 users listening to him on Spotify. |
| **Length & Popularity** | Many music genres (Pop, Rap, Rock, Dance, etc.) have an average duration ranging from **$3.5$ to $4$ minutes**. |

#### Task 2: Health Data Analysis

[cite\_start]Analysis was conducted using the Health dataset to find trends that could be used by an organization for future support[cite: 15, 16].

  * [cite\_start]**Reflection on NHS Support:** This data could support decision-making for the NHS, as data is increasingly being used and can be lifesaving[cite: 17, 18].

| Analysis Area | [cite\_start]Key Findings [cite: 18] |
| :--- | :--- |
| **BMI per Country** | **Tonga** has the highest BMI, and **Bangladesh** has the lowest. |
| **Cancer Rates** | **China** has the highest overall cancer rates, much more than the US and Japan. |
| **Lung Cancer Rate** | **China** also has the highest lung cancer rate with $7,162,300$ people. |
| **Life Expectancy** | The average life expectancy has **gradually increased** in each continent over the years. |
| **BMI vs. Life Expectancy** | The average life expectancy correlates to the average BMI (e.g., Iceland has an average life expectancy of $79.73$ with an average BMI score of $25.80$). |

### Days 3 & 4: Power BI Desktop Labs

[cite\_start]The final part of the workbook involved completing practical laboratory exercises in **Power BI Desktop**[cite: 19, 24, 29, 34].

| Day | Task | Lab Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 3** | [cite\_start]Task 1 [cite: 19] | Lab 1: **Get Data** in Power BI Desktop |
| **Day 3** | [cite\_start]Task 2 [cite: 24] | Lab 2: **Load Transformed Data** in Power BI Desktop |
| **Day 4** | [cite\_start]Task 1 [cite: 29] | Lab 8: **Design a Report** in Power BI Desktop |
| **Day 4** | [cite\_start]Task 2 [cite: 34] | Lab 12: **Create a Power BI Dashboard** |
