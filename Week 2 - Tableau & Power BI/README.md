### Day 1: Tableau Research and Dashboard Creation

#### Task 1: Tableau Versions Comparison

Research was conducted to compare different Tableau versions and explain the limitations of **Tableau Public**.

  * **Tableau Public Limitations:** Its functionality is limited primarily by a lack of **data security**, its inability to connect to **private databases and cloud services**, and its **online-only publishing model**.

#### Task 2: EMSI Job Change Dashboard

A Tableau dashboard was created using the `EMSI_JobChange_UK` dataset.

  * **Dashboard Components:** A bar chart showing **percentage change** and a UK-based map illustrating the **key city locations impacted**.

### Day 2: Advanced Data Analysis in Tableau

Analysis was performed on two distinct datasets to find and document trends, with visualizations created for each.

#### Task 1: Spotify Data Analysis

Analysis was conducted to find trends and key information for potential future projects.

| Analysis Area | [cite\_start]Key Findings [cite: 13] |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Genre Popularity** | **Pop music** is the most popular genre on Spotify with 625,020 users. Acapella is the least popular with only 1,107 users. |

| **Length & Popularity** | Many music genres (Pop, Rap, Rock, Dance, etc.) have an average duration ranging from **$3.5$ to $4$ minutes**. |

#### Task 2: Health Data Analysis

Analysis was conducted using the Health dataset to find trends that could be used by an organization for future support.

  * **Reflection on NHS Support:** This data could support decision-making for the NHS, as data is increasingly being used and can be lifesaving.

| Analysis Area | [cite\_start]Key Findings [cite: 18] |
| :--- | :--- |
| **BMI per Country** | **Tonga** has the highest BMI, and **Bangladesh** has the lowest. |
| **Cancer Rates** | **China** has the highest overall cancer rates, much more than the US and Japan. |
| **Lung Cancer Rate** | **China** also has the highest lung cancer rate with $7,162,300$ people. |
| **Life Expectancy** | The average life expectancy has **gradually increased** in each continent over the years. |
| **BMI vs. Life Expectancy** | The average life expectancy correlates to the average BMI (e.g., Iceland has an average life expectancy of $79.73$ with an average BMI score of $25.80$). |
