Workbook: Week 1 - Data and Microsoft Excel
This workbook serves as an introduction to foundational concepts in data governance and core data analysis skills using spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel.
Dataset Snapshot
The following image shows a portion of the retail sales data used for the foundational spreadsheet tasks.

1. Data Governance and Compliance
This section involves an in-depth analysis of key UK and EU data protection laws.
Laws Covered: Data Protection Act, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Freedom of Information Act, and Computer Misuse Act.
Focus: Understanding the purpose, importance, and real-world application of each law, as well as the consequences of breaching them.

2. Foundational Spreadsheet Skills
Practical exercises were performed using the retail-sales_dataset.xlsx.
Skills:
Adding data to a structured table.
Sorting data (e.g., sorting the “Age” column from largest to smallest).
Calculating basic statistics using Excel functions: “SUM” (for totals) and “AVERAGE” (for averages).

3. Advanced Spreadsheet Analysis
This section focused on hands-on experience with advanced data summarization techniques.
Technique: Creating and interpreting Pivot Tables on a dedicated bike sales dataset.
Analysis Included: Findings related to market, age group, and gender profitability.

4. Conditional Data Categorization
Application of advanced conditional logic for data classification.
Function: Utilized the “SWITCH” function in Excel.
Goal: Categorizing products into "High," "Medium," or "Low" sales volumes based on predefined sales thresholds.

5. Data Interpretation
Tasks involving basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and extremes.
Functions: Used “MAX” and “MIN” to identify sales extremes (highest and lowest sales) per region.
Skills: Filtering data based on specific criteria (e.g., filtering by game manufacturer and year).

Technical Skills Demonstrated
Software: Microsoft Excel (or equivalent spreadsheet software)
Concepts:
Data Protection Law (GDPR, DPA)
Relational Data
Data Summarization (SUM, AVERAGE, Pivot Tables)
Conditional Logic (SWITCH function)
Data Visualisation Tools (Evaluated)
