## Workbook: Week 3 - MySQL (Database Concepts & SQL) ðŸ’¾

The primary theme of this workbook is the **theoretical and practical application of database concepts** and the **Structured Query Language (SQL)**.

***

### 1. Database Theory

This section covered the definition and application of fundamental database components and relationships.

* **Key Definitions:**
    * **Primary Keys:** Unique identifiers for records.
    * **Secondary Keys:** Indexed fields used for fast retrieval.
    * **Foreign Keys:** Links between tables, enforcing referential integrity.
* **Relational Schema Examples:** Developed real-world examples for the three main types of relational relationships:
    * **One-to-One**
    * **One-to-Many**
    * **Many-to-Many**

### 2. Database Models Comparison

A detailed comparison was performed to differentiate between two major database paradigms.

* **Relational Databases (SQL):** Characterized by **structured data** and a **fixed schema** (e.g., MySQL).
* **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):** Characterized by a **flexible schema** and designed for **horizontal scaling**.
* **NoSQL Benefit:** Identified data types (e.g., **unstructured data**, **big data**) that benefit most from the NoSQL model.

### 3. Advanced SQL Joins

Comprehensive research and explanation of all major SQL JOIN types were completed.

| SQL JOIN Type | Purpose and Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Inner Join** | Returns only matching rows from both tables. |
| **Left Join** | Returns all rows from the left table, and the matching rows from the right table. |
| **Right Join** | Returns all rows from the right table, and the matching rows from the left table. |
| **Full Join** | Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables. |
| **Self-Join** | Joins a table to itself. |
| **Cross Join** | Returns the Cartesian product of the rows in the tables. |

### 4. Database Design & Implementation

A written essay task outlining the full process of setting up a new database system for a small retail business was completed.

* **Process Covered:**
    * **Business Requirements**
    * **Schema Design** (creating tables for Inventory, Sales, Customer)
    * **Implementation** (writing SQL commands for table creation)
    * **Maintenance** (strategies for backups and security)

### 5. Practical SQL Querying

Numerous SQL query scenarios were executed on a world city/country dataset, demonstrating practical querying skills.

* **Query Tasks Included:**
    * Finding cities with a specific prefix or within a certain population range.
    * Calculating **Average Population by Country** (Data Aggregation).
    * Identifying countries with high/low **GDP** or **population density**.
